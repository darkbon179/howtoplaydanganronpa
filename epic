This is a guide for Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.
										
										
													Main Trial								AND									Hangman's Gambit
In Danganronpa, truth bullets are used as evidence. When you see yellow text in a class trial, you need to fire your truth
bullet at that text. The thing is... you might not know what you need to fire at, because there are multiple times where you
might see yellow text in one nonstop debate. This means you need to get the right lie/contradiction, but make sure you don't 
mess up too many times, because you have an "influence meter" which acts as a health bar. If your influence meter reaches 0,
you are found guilty and lose. There are minigames in class trials too, like Hangman's Gambit, which is a word search type 
of minigame in which you need to find the correct letter. When you have finished Hangman's Gambit and you are nearly done 
with the trial, you will need to piece together the story of the murder by dragging and dropping the spheres.














																							Bullet Time Battle (BTB)



When you have pieced the story together, you will need to do a Bullet Time Battle, which is based entirely around rhythm.
When the tempo goes up and you are finished, you will need to perform a final strike, and end the trial.
